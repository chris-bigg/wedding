UberX is also available in the Gloucester area as a rideshare option. You can request a ride using an app or call a local firm.",
		parking: `No, there is no visitor parking immediately on-site, but charged public parking is available next door.
Specifics:
* The nearest car parks are the Ladybellegate Street Car Park (Gloucester City Council) and the NCP Gloucester Blackfriars car park. Both are paid parking.
